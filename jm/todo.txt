CBs:
- Eraniss culture gives you Ducal Unification. (if you control land in a dutchy, can declare war on any independent who holds land in the dutchy for that land - including the ducal title itself) (costs??) (if you're a vassal you can declare this on equal-level vassals, but not the liege) --- DONE?
- CB to conquest a county of same-religion ruled by different-religion.
- No holy wars or conquest with the religion - ideally, make it so that eraniss culture turns off holy wars, but the religion allows it?
- Can we do a CB that lets you force a war to make others abdicate to a dynast of yours in the succession?
- Add a CB (havenite culture?) to force targets to true cognatic.
- Try to let the Radliens convert a province adjacent (or near enough?) that isn't theirs, no matter the owner/culture/etc.
- Girralatia gets a strong claim on tributary breakage.

Characters:
Girralatia: no character yet (should hold all the baronies, I think? definitely ALSO the ducal title.)
Laset: Dynasty. Other tweaks?
Ramias: needs to exist.



Starting laws:
- Haven/Girralatia: Cognatic
- Haven: locked into Cognatic, even.


Decision:
Haven gets a way to set up an MTTH event on other people: significant reduction on dynasts, also opinion matters.
while diplomancing, some events can happen: possible to get a favor, possible to get opinion up, possible to get a special opinion modifier that effectively pagan-subjugations them on a cb, possible to get a peaceful vassal (but dynast is very important for that)
research: can we make it so this cb on a vassal lets you fight their leige for them?


Starting tech.


Havenite government, maybe? ducal+titles would operate as follows:
- only allow elective succession plus have events every few years (on a specific pulse or something) that somehow decide if it goes to the heir or the holder keeps it. (based on ... idk, opinions or something. poke that with a stick.)
For players, it should trigger an event to the holder. two options: can abdicate fully, or can have only the title+capital go. (maybe somehow check for other titles for the ai decision, or just make it choose based on "going to unlanded dynast" vs "anything else", idk.)


Religion:
- Girralatia gets something secular, for sure.
- Haven's religion is weird.

(holy sites??)
Maybe a uniform "secular religion"? It would ban religious revocation law!!



Buildings:
Custom buildings! Replace some of the base stuff, for the culture.

Have a provincial decision that flips buildings, if any exist.



Magic system: ?????
